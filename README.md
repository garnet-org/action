3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Name: `GARNET_API_TOKEN`
5. Value: Your GarnetAI API token from step 1
6. Click "Add secret"

## 📋 Usage

### Basic Usage

Add the following to your workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`):

```yaml
name: Security Monitoring

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  monitor:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Run GarnetAI Security Scanner
        uses: garnet-org/action@v1
        with:
          api_token: ${{ secrets.GARNET_API_TOKEN }}
```

### Advanced Usage with Custom Parameters

For more control, you can customize the action with additional parameters:

```yaml
name: Security Monitoring

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  monitor:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Run GarnetAI Security Scanner
        uses: garnet-org/action@v1
        with:
          api_token: ${{ secrets.GARNET_API_TOKEN }}
          api_url: https://api.garnet.ai
          garnetctl_version: 1.2.0
          jibril_version: 0.9.5
          debug: true
```

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

| Name | Description | Required | Default |
|------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `api_token` | API token for GarnetAI service | Yes | N/A |
| `api_url` | API URL for GarnetAI service | No | `https://api.garnet.ai` |
| `garnetctl_version` | Version of garnetctl CLI to download | No | `latest` |
| `jibril_version` | Jibril release version (without v prefix) | No | `0.0` |
| `debug` | Enable detailed debug output | No | `false` |

## 🔍 How It Works

When this action runs, it follows these steps:

1. ⬇️ **Downloads required tools** - Fetches garnetctl and Jibril loader
2. 📝 **Creates context** - Builds GitHub context with workflow information
3. 🔑 **Registers agent** - Creates a Garnet agent for this workflow run
4. 📋 **Configures monitoring** - Uses the configuration file from ./config/loader.yaml
5. 🛡️ **Gets policy** - Retrieves the network policy for the repository and workflow
6. 🚀 **Starts scanner** - Launches the Jibril loader as a systemd service

The security monitoring runs in the background for the duration of your workflow, detecting suspicious activity. The configuration includes extensive detection events for file access, execution monitoring, and network peer analysis.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- ✅ Verify your API token has the proper permissions
- ✅ Check that your workflow has sudo access for running the loader
- ✅ Ensure the agent can properly register with GarnetAI
- ✅ Check logs in the GitHub Actions output for detailed information
