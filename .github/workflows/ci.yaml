# CI: build the action bundles and verify dist/ is committed and up to date.
#
# This repo ships pre-built dist/ (ncc bundles) so consumers don't need to build.
# If you change src/, run `npm run build` and commit the updated dist/ — this
# workflow fails when dist/ is out of sync with a fresh build.
